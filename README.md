## VOCABULARY_BEE
We created an app that translates words/phrases from user input from English to French.  The user can then test their knowledge with the flashcard component based on the phrases that were input by the user. To gain further knowledge and practice there is a quiz component to test the practice they've made so far.

Local passport was used for user signup/login.  IBM/ Watson Translate was the API used for english/ french translation.  Install all required dependencies.
